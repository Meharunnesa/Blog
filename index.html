        <p>Bangladesh all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad has said that the Tigers are yet to demonstrate their best brand of cricket in the ongoing three-match series against Sri Lanka, reports UNB.</p>
        <p>Bangladesh have already sealed the series winning the first two games on 23 and 25 May. Both teams are now set to lock horns in the final game today (Friday) at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, Mirpur.</p>
        <p>“I think we’re yet to demonstrate our best cricket. We have discussed it amongst ourselves. So we’ll try to play our best cricket (in the last game). I think our top-order suffered a collapse in both of the games and middle-order and late middle-order also disappointed. We could do better in these areas, and we’re looking into it,” Mahmudullah told newspersons on Thursday.</p>
